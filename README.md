# Automated SRIM simulations with Python

This is a repository with python scripts for autmatic use of the SRIM tool. It is based on a python package called srim, available from the web. 

SRIM is the stopping and range of ions in matter tool widely used in different areas of physics to simulate the stopping process of high energetic ions in carious types of matter. The tool was extended to serve for the simulation of ion implantation through a pinhole made out of steel. <br>

Check the scripts for more details.
